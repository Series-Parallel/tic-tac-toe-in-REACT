This is the best way to learn React by building all time favourite game in schools!
In this project I used all the classic React Hooks and made game from scratch with the help from course-"React-The Complete Guide" on Udemey. Thannks Udemey for providng wonderful courses!!

By building this game my all the basic concepts of react are now cleared. I am posting this repository so that anyone who is learning react can build this game and anyone who is watching that course on udemy can also get the code.
